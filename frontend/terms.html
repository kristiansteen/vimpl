                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    These Trial Subscription Terms supplement and modify the General Terms and Conditions (Section 2)
                    when the Customer accesses the vimpl.com Boards under a trial subscription. In the event of any
                    conflict between these Trial Subscription Terms and the General Terms and Conditions, these Trial
                    Subscription Terms shall prevail during the Trial Period.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.1 Trial Period</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The Customer may access the vimpl.com Boards on a trial basis for a period of thirty (30) days from
                    the date of activation ("Trial Period"). The Trial Period is available only to new customers who
                    have not previously subscribed to the Service.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.2 No Payment Obligation During Trial</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    No payment shall be required during the Trial Period. The Customer shall not be charged any fees for
                    access to the Solution during the Trial Period unless the Customer explicitly elects to convert to a
                    paid subscription prior to the expiration of the Trial Period.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.3 Automatic Conversion to Paid Subscription
                </h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    Unless the Customer cancels the trial subscription prior to the end of the Trial Period, the trial
                    subscription shall automatically convert to a paid subscription at the then-current standard
                    pricing. The Customer authorizes vimpl.com to charge the payment method on file beginning on the
                    first day following the expiration of the Trial Period.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.4 Trial Limitations</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    During the Trial Period, the Customer's access to the Solution may be subject to certain limitations
                    as specified in the trial offer. vimpl.com reserves the right to modify these limitations at any
                    time during the Trial Period.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.5 Cancellation of Trial</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The Customer may cancel the trial subscription at any time during the Trial Period without incurring
                    any charges or penalties. Cancellation must be completed at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to
                    the end of the Trial Period to avoid automatic conversion to a paid subscription. Cancellation may
                    be effected through the Customer's account settings or by contacting vimpl.com customer support.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.6 Data Retention Upon Trial Expiration</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    Upon expiration or cancellation of the Trial Period, Customer Data shall be retained for a period of
                    thirty (30) days. If the Customer does not convert to a paid subscription within this retention
                    period, all Customer Data may be permanently deleted. vimpl.com shall have no obligation to retain
                    or return Customer Data following this retention period.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The Solution is provided on an "as-is" basis during the Trial Period. vimpl.com makes no guarantees
                    regarding uptime, performance, or availability during the Trial Period. The Service Level Agreement
                    provisions, if any, contained in the General Terms and Conditions shall not apply during the Trial
                    Period.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">1.8 Modification or Termination of Trial
                    Offering</h3>

                    access and use the Solution. For the purpose of this Clause, "use" shall mean the right to use the
                    Solution and any related material such as Offline Materials as intended or contemplated for the
                    Customer's or its Affiliates' own internal business purposes, however, limited to the actual number
                    of Users paid for by the Customer as well as on the terms and conditions reflected in the Agreement.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The right of access and use of the Solution of each User is strictly personal. Hence, each User

                    others or otherwise permit or allow others to access and use the Solution on behalf of the User in
                    question, including others within in the organisation of the Customer.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The use of Offline Material by each User is also personal. Hence, any User having stored or
                    downloaded such Offline Materials locally may only use such Offline Materials itself and shall
                    protect such Offline Materials against access from and use by others, including others within the
                    organisation of the Customer, unless agreed otherwise in writing with vimpl.com. For instance such
                    Offline Material may not be stored in folders, which can be accessed by others or only be stored
                    subject to protection by a password only known by the specific User.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    During the Term, the Customer may add Additional Users against the applicable Charge per User set
                    out in the Order Form (it being understood that the Charges always apply for a full month
                    notwithstanding when the Additional User is added/activated). This may be done by a request to
                    vimpl.com or by a Super User setting up such new Additional User directly in the Solution (however,
                    a Super User can only add an End User and not a Super User). The Customer confirms that each Super
                    User designated by the Customer is duly authorised to create Additional Users in the Solution and to
                    incur the relevant Charges associated with such Additional User on behalf of the Customer.

                    wish to carry forward into the subsequent Renewal Term (in such a way that the Additional User has
                    been removed and no longer has access to the Solution). If the Customer does not
                    de-register/de-activate those Additional Users prior to the commencement of the subsequent Renewal

                    additional cost to the Customer). Such replacements shall take effect from the first of a month and
                    must not result in simultaneous or unauthorised access to the Solution. vimpl.com reserves the right
                    to require - and the Customer is obliged to provide - reasonable documentation to verify the

                    date until the date of payment, at the rate to be charged in case of late payment pursuant to the
                    Danish Interest Rates Act (in Danish: "Renteloven").

                    the Solution, and other services, including reasonable travel costs. The costs of travel time shall
                    be calculated on the basis of vimpl.com's hourly rate. Mileages will be calculated using the

                    third-party terms and conditions (which apply between the Customer and the third-party supplier,
                    even if vimpl.com acts as the direct supplier), and the Customer is responsible for complying with
                    those terms. vimpl.com makes no representations and disclaims any warranties regarding any
                    Third-Party Services, including (without limitation) their accuracy, completeness, or authenticity
                    or any interaction between the Customer (or a User) and the third-party supplier, provided however
                    that vimpl.com will not use Third Party Services that uses Customer Data for any other purposes than
                    providing the Solution to the Customer, including for training of AI-models for vimpl.com's or such
                    third party supplier's own benefit. To the extent possible and permissible, vimpl.com will pass on
                    to the Customer any warranties or rights it receives from such third-party suppliers. In any event,
                    vimpl.com's liability relating to Third-Party Services is limited to the liability the relevant
                    third-party supplier has towards vimpl.com, so that Customer does not obtain a better legal position
                    against vimpl.com than vimpl.com has against the third-party supplier.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The aggregate liability of a Party under the Agreement shall in no event exceed an amount equal to
                    100 % of the total Charges paid by Customer in the twelve (12) months period preceding the date of
                    the first claim made for the part of the Solution in question. If the Agreement has not been in
                    force twelve (12) months at the time of occurrence of the breach for which the first claim is made,
                    the "total Charges" shall be deemed to include all Charges paid for the actual period lapsed for
                    such part of the Solution and multiplied with a factor to correspond to a twelve (12) month period.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The Parties shall not be liable for indirect losses, loss of profits, business, revenue, goodwill,
                    or data unless otherwise provided in the Agreement.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    The limitation of liability under clauses 2.12.1 and 2.12.2 shall apply to any and all claims
                    irrespective of the basis of the claims, i.e. damages, proportionate reduction and penalties.
                    However, the limitation of liability under clauses 2.12.1 and 2.12.2 shall not apply to the Charges
                    payable by Customer.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes the liability of a party for: (i) any death or personal
                    injury caused by its negligence, (ii) any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence or
                    wilful misconduct, or (iii) any statutory or other liability, which, in all cases ((i)-(iii)),
                    cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

                <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 12px; color: var(--gray-900);">2.13 INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                    vimpl.com will (i) defend any third-party claim against the Customer during the term of the
                    Agreement to the extent the claim alleges that the Solution directly infringes the third party's
                    Intellectual Property Rights and (ii) indemnify the Customer for any losses, fees, costs, and
                    damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction (or settlement amounts agreed to in
                    writing by vimpl.com) for such infringement.
